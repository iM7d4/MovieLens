# MovieLens

## Project Description
---
* This project is a case study for a start-up, involved with recommending movies to users as a service, as well as investigating certain factors contributing to the success of movies.
* The aim of this project, is to perform Extract, Transform, Load, on movies data, to answer questions the business may have about its users, such as:
    * What is the highest rated movie of all time?
    * Which genre of movies are the most popular with users?
    * Trends in box office earnings - Does releasing a movie at a certain quarter/month of a year, lead to higher box office earnings?
    * Which genres are the highest earning of all-time, normalized against a consumer price index?

* The movies data and metadata comes from Movielens, extracted from a [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset). The data contains 26 million user ratings of over 270,000 users on a collection of over 45,000 movies.
* In addition, Consumer Price Index of Admission to Movies, Theaters, and Concerts in U.S. City Average is extracted from [Here](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CUSR0000SS62031). This will help us normalize box office earnings against inflation over the years.
